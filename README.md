# **Credit Card Fraud Detection - Data Visualization**  

This project explores credit card fraud detection through **data visualization** using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**. The goal is to uncover insights into fraudulent transactions and their characteristics.  

## 📊 **Key Visualizations**  

### **1️⃣ Class Distribution: Fraud vs. Non-Fraud**  
Fraudulent transactions make up a **small fraction** of the dataset, but their impact is significant.  

📌 **Key Insights:**  
- Fraud cases are rare but can involve **high transaction amounts**.  
- Non-fraud transactions dominate, making fraud detection challenging.
